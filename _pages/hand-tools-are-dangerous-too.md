Hand tool woodworking, like any other activity, can pose certain dangers if proper precautions are not taken. Here are some potential dangers associated with hand tool woodworking:

| Potential danger | Details |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Cuts and lacerations | Working with sharp hand tools such as chisels, knives, and planes increases the risk of cuts and lacerations. Slippery or unsteady workpieces, improper hand placement, and lack of focus can lead to accidents. |
| Strain or repetitive stress injuries | Woodworking often requires repetitive movements, such as sawing or planing, which can lead to strain or repetitive stress injuries over time. Conditions like tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or back pain can develop if proper ergonomics and technique are not maintained. Using tools that are too heavy or poorly balanced can also contribute to these injuries. |
| Eye injuries | Woodworking produces flying chips, dust, and debris that can cause eye injuries if proper eye protection, such as safety goggles or a face shield, is not worn. Woodworking activities like sawing or chiseling create small particles that can easily get into the eyes. |
| Dust inhalation | Woodworking generates a significant amount of fine dust particles, especially when sawing, sanding, or shaping wood. Inhaling wood dust can cause respiratory problems, allergies, and potentially serious lung conditions like occupational asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). |
| Fire hazards | Sawdust and wood shavings are highly flammable. Accidental sparks, hot tools, or improper storage and handling of flammable substances can lead to fires or explosions. |

To minimize these dangers, it is essential to follow safety guidelines, wear appropriate protective equipment, maintain tools in good condition, work in a well-ventilated area, and receive proper training on tool usage and woodworking techniques. Adhering to safety practices and being mindful of potential risks can help mitigate the dangers associated with hand tool woodworking.
