Wood is a natural, fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and branches of trees and woody plants. Wood serves as the main structural material in trees, providing support and conducting water and nutrients between the roots and leaves.

Wood is made up of tiny fibers, like really thin and long strings. These fibers are very special because they give wood its strength and durability. They're packed together tightly, like a bunch of straws bundled up.

## Beyond the basics (optional)

Wood is primarily made from three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These components are complex organic compounds that provide structural support and other essential properties to the wood.

| Component | Details |
| - | - |
| Cellulose | Cellulose is the most abundant organic compound found in wood. It is a polysaccharide composed of glucose units linked together in long chains. Cellulose provides strength and rigidity to the wood fibers, contributing to its structural integrity. |
| Hemicellulose | Hemicellulose is a group of complex carbohydrates that surround and interconnect cellulose fibers in wood. It is composed of various sugar molecules such as xylose, glucose, and mannose. Hemicellulose acts as a cementing substance, binding cellulose fibers together and providing flexibility and resilience to the wood. |
| Lignin | Lignin is a complex polymer that fills the spaces between cellulose and hemicellulose in wood. It is responsible for the wood's hardness, durability, and resistance to decay. Lignin provides rigidity to the cell walls, enhancing the structural integrity of the wood and contributing to its overall strength. |
