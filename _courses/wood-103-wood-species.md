A tree species refers to a particular type or kind of tree that belongs to a specific biological classification. Different tree species have distinct wood properties, which make them suitable for different purposes, such as:
- Density
- Strength
- Color
- Grain patterns

### Hardwood vs softwood

Wood can also be classified into two main types: hardwood and softwood.
- Hardwood comes from deciduous trees (angiosperms) like oak, maple, and mahogany, and it tends to be denser and more durable. 
- Softwood, on the other hand, comes from coniferous trees (gymnosperms) such as pine, spruce, and cedar, and it is generally less dense and more easily worked.
