There are several alternatives to wood that are used in various applications.

For example, engineered wood products, such as plywood, particleboard, and medium-density fiberboard (MDF), are made by binding together wood fibers or veneers with adhesives. These products offer greater stability, consistency, and resistance to warping compared to solid wood.

Choice of material depends on the specific application and desired properties. In this curriculum, we'll leverage these alternatives when it's appropriate.
